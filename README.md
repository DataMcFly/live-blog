Live blogging with Data McFly and Twilio

This is a simple live blogging app that can be plugged into any website, users 
can then use their phones to send updates (texts or images) to the specified phone number and updates are displayed in real-time on the website.

The backend is powered by Node.js to receive the messages from Twilio, then displayed on your website via Javascript.

These can be hosted separately or together, and we'll go over how to break these down.
